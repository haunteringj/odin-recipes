            <p>On the table and ready to tuck into, in just under 40 minutes. This is one of the best recipes with sausage and it's easy to make, just like other Gordon Ramsay recipes such as Spaghetti Bolognese or Filet Mignon.</p>
            <h4>Ingredients...</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tbsp olive oil, for frying</li>
                <li>1 red onion, sliced</li>
                <li>1 red pepper, deseeded and chopped (but not too small)</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves, very finely sliced</li>
                <li>5 spiced sausages, e.g. Italian chilli</li>
                <li>1 heaped teaspoon smoked paprika (Gordon uses La Chinata brand)</li>
                <li>200g long-grain rice (1 cup)</li>
                <li>½ glass dry white wine</li>
                <li>500ml (2 cups) chicken stock - I used a Knorr stockpot</li>
                <li>4 spring onions, trimmed and sliced</li>
                <li>2 tomatoes, roughly chopped</li>       
                <li>Small bunch of flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Cooking Steps...</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Add just 1 tbsp of Olive oil to a heavy-based casserole dish and fry the onion for 5 minutes until soft but not coloured.</li>
                <li>Add the pepper and garlic and cook for 2 minutes while moving it about so the garlic doesn't burn.</li>
                <li>Slit the sausage skins and crumble the sausage meat so it looks like small meatballs.</li>
                <li>Turn the heat to high (otherwise, the sausage will steam rather than brown). Cook while moving it about a bit in the pan for about 4-5 minutes until coloured.</li>
                <li>Add the smoked paprika and mix and season to taste.</li>
                <li>Add the rice and stir well to mix thoroughly and absorb the flavour.</li>
                <li>Now deglaze the pan by pouring in the white wine and scraping any bits stuck to the bottom.</li>
                <li>Add the stock and bring to a boil and then turn to a simmer.</li>
                <li>Cook gently for 15–20 minutes until the rice is tender and the liquid almost entirely absorbed. Keep an eye on it and stir from time to time.</li>
                <li>Remove from the heat, gently fold in the spring onions, tomato and parsley and serve.</li>
            </ol>
