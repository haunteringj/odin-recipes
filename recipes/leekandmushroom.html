            In one of the episodes, Gordon shared 'Quick TV Dinners' - Mushroom and Leek Pasta, Farfalle with ricotta, pancetta & peas, Tagliatelle with quick sausage meat bolognaise, Spaghetti with chilly, sardines & oregano and Sweet corn fritters & yoghurt dip, for his Mushroom and Leek Pasta he used Lasagna sheets and I loved the way he created amazing pasta dish with three humble ingredients - leek, mushroom and lasagna sheets.

        <h4>Ingredients...</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>5 - 6 Dried Lasagna Sheets</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp Olive Oil</li>
            <li>2 Medium Leeks, trimmed and sliced</li>
            <li>5 - 6 Button Mushrooms, washed, trimmed and sliced</li>
            <li>2 Garlic Cloves, sliced</li>
            <li>Â¼ Cup Fresh Cream</li>
            <li>1 Cup Chicken Stock (see recipe here) or Vegetable Stock</li>
            <br/>
            <li>For seasoning:</li>
            <li>Salt and Black Pepper, as per taste</li>
            <li>Oregano, red chilly flakes</li>
            <li>Fistful of flat parsley</li>       
        </ul>
        <h4>Cooking Steps...</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a pan and saute sliced mushrooms for 5 minutes. Add garlic cloves and stir nicely.</li>
            <li>Mix in chopped leeks and pour chicken stock, season with salt and pepper. Let it simmer on low flame for 5 minutes until liquids are reduced, add cream and again let it simmer for 3 - 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Boil water in a pan and when it is bubbling hot drop in lasagna sheets. Make sure lasagna sheets do not stick to the bottom of the pan. Once pasta is cooked drain it in colander and rinse under cold water.</li>
            <li>Pile lasagna sheets one on top of other and cut lengthwise into 2 inch wide strips.</li>
            <li>Add the lasagna strips into the simmering sauce and let it sit there for 5 minutes so that pasta absorbs the sauce.</li>
            <li>Switch of the gas and finish with oregano, chilly flakes and parsley.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with grilled toast!!</li>
        </ol>
